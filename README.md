# Sylheti Nagri OCR System with MMOCR

This repository contains the implementation of an OCR system for Sylheti Nagri script using [MMOCR](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmocr). This work was presented at the **EICT Conference 2023** in the paper:

**[A SAR-Based Approach to Recognize Text in Syloti Nagri](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10427969)**

## Description

Sylheti Nagri is a script used to write the Sylheti language, primarily spoken in northeastern Bangladesh and parts of India. This project employs a SAR-based approach to recognize Sylheti Nagri text, leveraging state-of-the-art Optical Character Recognition tools.

The system was developed and tested using MMOCR, a comprehensive toolbox for text detection, recognition, and understanding.

## Features

- Recognizes Sylheti Nagri script using a SAR-based approach.
- Notebook-based implementation for ease of understanding and experimentation.
